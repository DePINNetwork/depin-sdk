# Protocol buffer Annotations

This document explains the various protobuf scalars that have been added to make working with protobuf easier for Cosmos SDK application developers.

## Signer

Signer specifies which field should be used to determine the signer of a message for the Cosmos SDK. This field can be used for clients as well to infer which field should be used to determine the signer of a message.

Read more about the signer field [here](./02-messages-and-queries.md).

```protobuf reference 
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e6848d99b55a65d014375b295bdd7f9641aac95e/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/tx.proto#L40
```

```proto
option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "from_address";
```

## Scalar

The scalar type defines a way for clients to understand how to construct protobuf messages according to what is expected by the module and sdk.

```proto
(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"
```

Example of account address string scalar:

```proto reference 
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e6848d99b55a65d014375b295bdd7f9641aac95e/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/tx.proto#L46
```

Example of validator address string scalar: 

```proto reference 
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/query.proto#L87
```

Example of pubkey scalar: 

```proto reference 
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/11068bfbcd44a7db8af63b6a8aa079b1718f6040/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/tx.proto#L94
```

Example of Decimals scalar: 

```proto reference
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/distribution.proto#L26
```

Example of Int scalar: 

```proto reference
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L137
```

There are a few options for what can be provided as a scalar: `cosmos.AddressString`, `cosmos.ValidatorAddressString`, `cosmos.ConsensusAddressString`, `cosmos.Int`, `cosmos.Dec`. 

## Implements_Interface

Implement interface is used to provide information to client tooling like [telescope](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/telescope) on how to encode and decode protobuf messages. 

```proto
option (cosmos_proto.implements_interface) = "cosmos.auth.v1beta1.AccountI";
```

## Method,Field,Message Added In

`method_added_in`, `field_added_in` and `message_added_in` are annotations to denotate to clients that a field has been supported in a later version. This is useful when new methods or fields are added in later versions and that the client needs to be aware of what it can call.

The annotation should be worded as follow:

```proto
option (cosmos_proto.method_added_in) = "cosmos-sdk v0.50.1";
option (cosmos_proto.method_added_in) = "x/epochs v1.0.0";
option (cosmos_proto.method_added_in) = "simapp v24.0.0";
```

## Amino

The amino codec was removed in `v0.50+`, this means there is not a need register `legacyAminoCodec`. To replace the amino codec, Amino protobuf annotations are used to provide information to the amino codec on how to encode and decode protobuf messages. 

:::note
Amino annotations are only used for backwards compatibility with amino.

The below annotations are used to provide information to the amino codec on how to encode and decode protobuf messages in a backwards compatible manner. 

### Name

Name specifies the amino name that would show up for the user in order for them see which message they are signing.

```proto
option (amino.name) = "cosmos-sdk/BaseAccount";
```

```proto reference
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/tx.proto#L41
```

### Field_Name

Field name specifies the amino name that would show up for the user in order for them see which field they are signing.

```proto
uint64 height = 1 [(amino.field_name) = "public_key"];
```

```proto reference
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/distribution.proto#L166
```

### Dont_OmitEmpty 

Dont omitempty specifies that the field should not be omitted when encoding to amino. 

```proto
repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount = 3 [(amino.dont_omitempty)   = true];
```

```proto reference
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/bank.proto#L56
```

### Encoding 

Encoding instructs the amino json marshaler how to encode certain fields that may differ from the standard encoding behaviour. The most common example of this is how `repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` is encoded when using the amino json encoding format. The `legacy_coins` option tells the json marshaler [how to encode a null slice](https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/x/tx/signing/aminojson/json_marshal.go#L65) of `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin`.

```proto
(amino.encoding)         = "legacy_coins",
```

```proto reference
https://github.com/depinnetwork/depin-sdk/blob/e8f28bf5db18b8d6b7e0d94b542ce4cf48fed9d6/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/genesis.proto#L23
```

Another example is a protobuf `bytes` that contains a valid JSON document.
The `inline_json` option tells the json marshaler to embed the JSON bytes into the wrapping document without escaping.

```proto
(amino.encoding)         = "inline_json",
```

E.g. the bytes containing `{"foo":123}` in the `envelope` field would lead to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "envelope": {
    "foo": 123
  }
}
```

If the bytes are not valid JSON, this leads to JSON broken documents. Thus a JSON validity check needs to be in place at some point of the process.
